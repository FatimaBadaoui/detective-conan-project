            Detective Conan is about a teenage detective named Shinichi Kudo,
            who is poisoned by an evil group called "The Black Organization".
            The poison was supposed to kill him. However, the poison instead
            turned him into a small child. Shinichi adopts a new identity as
            "Conan Edogawa", and lives with his girlfriend, Ran Mouri, and her
            father, Detective Kogoro Mori, under the pretense that his parents
            are away and unable to take care of him. As a child, Shinichi/Conan
            helps Kogorou solve murder cases, while trying to find the evil men
            who poisoned him, to steal the poison and create an antidote.

          <p>
            This series has a lot of Mystery and suspance. Every Case is
            different than the one before and that show the immense imagination
            and creativity of Gosho Aoyama.
